# About
My Course Assignment project for creating a database around adoptions of animals.  


## What does this project include? 
 * A MySQL database for animal adoptions
 * Establishing relationships for each model
 * Utilizing Sequelize as the ORM
 * User registration and login with the use of Passport.js
 * User role authentication for different role rights by using a middleware to check the user's current role
 * Using EJS to display necessary elements dependent on the user's role
 * Populating the database with a set of raw SQL queries read from a json file when clicking the 'populate database' button if the database is empty.
 * Usage of dotenv for sensitive connection data
